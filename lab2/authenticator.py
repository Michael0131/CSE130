# 1. Name:
#      -Michael Johnson-
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 02: Authentication
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      -This program reads usernames and passwords from a JSON file and prompts the user to input their credentials. 
#       It checks the case-sensitive username and password for authentication, and informs the user if they are authorized. 
#       The program loops until the user chooses to exit.-
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      -The hardest part of this project for me was figuring out how to correctly set up and use the index to match the username with the 
#       corresponding password, especially since Iâ€™m a little rusty with Python. It took me a bit of time to remember how to get the index from 
#       the list of usernames and use that same index to compare the password at the same position in the passwords list. Once I got that sorted 
#       out, though, the rest of the project was fairly simple and straightforward. The logic for checking the username and password and then looping 
#       until the user wants to stop was easy to implement after I worked through the indexing part.-
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      -total time in hours including reading the assignment and submitting the program-
#      including the reading, and everything, about 4 hours.
